These components are in a separate directory because they are not components as such.
The elements in the Common Design Header and Footer have their markup and styles in the the base theme directly.
The components are in this repo for testing purposes only.
If you need the CD header and footer as context to try out some of the "real" components, use these.
They may not be up-to-date. If not, refer to https://github.com/UN-OCHA/common_design/ repo for current markup and styles.
